## SECTION 1: Introduction & Problem
**⏱️ Time: 0:00 - 0:25 (25 seconds)**

**[SCREEN: Show homepage with hero section]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "One in three college students experience mental health challenges, but seventy-five percent never seek help. The biggest barriers? Stigma, and not knowing who to talk to."
>
> "SunDevilCircles solves this with AI-powered peer matching. Instead of random connections, our AI analyzes your unique situation and connects you with students who truly understand what you're going through."
>
> "Let me show you exactly how it works."

---

## SECTION 2: Profile Data Collection - What the AI Learns
**⏱️ Time: 0:25 - 0:55 (30 seconds)**

**[SCREEN: Navigate to Onboarding or Profile Settings page]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Everything starts with your profile. During onboarding, we ask specific questions that power our matching algorithm."

**[SCREEN: Show the Support Topics selection]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "First, we collect your **support topics** - the challenges you're facing. This could be anxiety, academic stress, loneliness, relationship issues, or any combination of over 25 different topics."

**[SCREEN: Scroll to show Languages selection]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Second, your **languages**. International students often want to connect with peers who speak their native language. Our AI factors this into every match."

**[SCREEN: Show Cultural Background section]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Third, your **cultural background**. Someone from East Asia might better understand the academic pressures you face. Someone from the Middle East might share similar family expectations."

**[SCREEN: Show Support Style preference]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Fourth, your **support style preference**. Do you want someone who just listens? Someone who gives advice? Or a mix of both? The AI matches you with peers who complement your needs."

**[SCREEN: Show Graduation Year and Degree Program]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Finally, your **academic context** - graduation year and degree program. A freshman facing their first semester has different needs than a PhD student in their fifth year."

---

## SECTION 3: AI Peer Matching - The Algorithm Explained
**⏱️ Time: 0:55 - 1:50 (55 seconds)**

**[SCREEN: Navigate to Peers page, sorted by "Best Match"]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Now here's where the AI magic happens. Navigate to the Peers page and you'll see every potential connection ranked by match percentage."

**[SCREEN: Point to the match percentage badges - highlight one showing 92%]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "These percentages aren't random. Our AI uses a technique called **semantic embedding** - it converts your entire profile into a mathematical representation, then compares it against every other user in the system."

**[SCREEN: Hover over the top matched peer to show their details]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Let's break down why this user is a ninety-two percent match for me."

**[SCREEN: Show the peer card with visible topics/details]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "The AI identified that we share overlapping support topics - both of us selected anxiety and academic stress. That's weighted heavily because shared challenges create genuine empathy."

> "We also match on language - both of us speak English and Hindi. Language compatibility means we can communicate naturally without barriers."

> "Our cultural backgrounds overlap - we're both from South Asian households, so the AI understands we might share similar family dynamics and expectations."

> "And our support styles complement each other. I prefer mixed support, and this peer offers advice-based support - the AI sees that as complementary."

**[SCREEN: Show 2-3 more peer cards with different match percentages]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Notice how the percentages decrease as we go down. This user is only a sixty-three percent match - we share topics but have different languages and cultural backgrounds."

> "The AI doesn't just match on one factor. It **weighs all dimensions simultaneously** - topics, language, culture, academic context, and support style - to produce a holistic match score."

**[SCREEN: Click on "Connect" button on a high-match peer]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "When you find a strong match, one click sends a connection request. The other student can accept, and you can start chatting immediately."

---

## SECTION 4: AI Group Matching - Community Recommendations
**⏱️ Time: 1:50 - 2:25 (35 seconds)**

**[SCREEN: Navigate to Groups page, sorted by "Best Match"]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "The same AI powers our group recommendations. Navigate to Groups and you'll see forty-plus support groups, each ranked by how well they match your profile."

**[SCREEN: Show the top matched groups with percentages]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "My top recommendation is the Anxiety Support group at eighty-seven percent - because anxiety is my primary topic. Below that, Academic Problems at seventy-four percent matches my academic stress selection."

**[SCREEN: Click to show a group's details with topics listed]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Each group has associated topics. The AI compares YOUR topics against the GROUP's topics and calculates overlap. More overlap means a higher match."

**[SCREEN: Show the "Create Group" option]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "But what if the perfect group doesn't exist? Students can create their own. If I create a 'First-Gen CS Students' group, the AI will automatically recommend it to other first-generation computer science students based on their profiles."

**[SCREEN: Briefly show the create group form, then navigate away]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "This means the community grows organically, and the AI continuously learns to match new students with relevant communities."

---

## SECTION 5: Safety Layer + Professional Resources
**⏱️ Time: 2:25 - 2:50 (25 seconds)**

**[SCREEN: Show the Crisis Banner at the top]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Trust is essential for peer support. That's why we built multiple safety layers."

**[SCREEN: Navigate to chat or show chat interface]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Every message goes through real-time AI moderation. Harmful language is flagged instantly. If someone mentions crisis keywords, the system immediately surfaces professional resources."

**[SCREEN: Show the Resources Hub briefly]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Our Resources Hub bridges peer support to professional help - ASU Counseling Services, the 988 Suicide Lifeline, International Student Support - all organized and accessible."

**[SCREEN: Point to crisis contact links]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "We're not replacing professional mental health services. We're creating a comfortable first step that makes seeking help less intimidating."

---

## SECTION 6: Closing Statement
**⏱️ Time: 2:50 - 3:00 (10 seconds)**

**[SCREEN: Return to homepage or dashboard showing the full interface]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "SunDevilCircles uses AI to ensure that when you reach out for support, you're connected with someone who **understands** - not randomly, but intentionally."

> "Because no ASU student should have to struggle alone."

**[SCREEN: Hold on homepage for 2 seconds, then fade to black or end card]**

# 📊 AI MATCHING TECHNICAL SUMMARY
*Use this for reference when explaining the algorithm*

## How the Match Score is Calculated:

```
MATCH SCORE = 
    (Topic Overlap × 0.40)     ← 40% weight - most important
  + (Language Match × 0.20)    ← 20% weight
  + (Culture Match × 0.15)     ← 15% weight
  + (Support Style × 0.15)     ← 15% weight
  + (Academic Context × 0.10)  ← 10% weight (grad year, degree)
```

## Profile Dimensions the AI Analyzes:

| Dimension | What It Captures | Weight |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Support Topics | Anxiety, depression, stress, relationships, etc. | 40% |
| Languages | English, Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, etc. | 20% |
| Cultural Background | East Asia, South Asia, Middle East, Europe, etc. | 15% |
| Support Style | Listening, Advice, Mixed | 15% |
| Academic Context | Freshman-Senior, Bachelor's-PhD, Graduation Year | 10% |

## Semantic Embedding Explanation (Simple Terms):

> "The AI converts your entire profile into a 384-dimensional vector - essentially, a unique mathematical fingerprint. When comparing two users, the AI calculates the cosine similarity between their vectors. A score closer to 1.0 means near-identical profiles; closer to 0 means no overlap. We convert this to a percentage for easy understanding."

# 🎬 RECORDING TIPS

1. **Speak slowly and clearly** - especially technical terms like "semantic embedding"
2. **Pause on screens** - give viewers time to see what you're describing (2-3 seconds)
3. **Use smooth mouse movements** - don't jerk around the screen
4. **Highlight with cursor** - circle or hover over elements you're discussing
5. **Match voice energy to content** - more enthusiasm on impact statements
6. **Record in sections** - easier to edit than one long take

---

# ✂️ OPTIONAL CUTS (If Running Long)

If you need to shorten the video, cut in this order:

1. **First cut:** Reduce Section 5 (Safety) to 10 seconds
2. **Second cut:** Shorten Section 4 (Groups) - skip create group demo
3. **Third cut:** Reduce profile walkthrough to just mention "topics, language, culture, support style"

**Never cut:** The AI matching explanation in Section 3 - this is your core differentiator
